# Exercise: Refactor useReducer

## Goal:
Refactor the useReducer-demo, so that the part the user interacts with (dropdown lists for color and pet) and the part that displays what is currently selected reside in separate components.

1. Start with all in one file (App.js).

2. Create separate files for the new components.
